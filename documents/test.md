# Test

In the test section, we design tests to verify the ability of LFTP to exchange file between clients and servers and serve multiple clients at the same time. Also, we'll exam the reliability of RDP. Besides, flow control and congestion control of RDP won't be absent in our test.

## LFTP

### Send File to Server

In this test, we try to send a 1.79 GB file and a 3 bytes file to check whether LFTP clients could send both large files and small files.
