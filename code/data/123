I want to encode some data as Base64, and then have the encoded data concatenated in a string.

when I do:

four=base64.urlsafe_b64encode(bytes(MAIL, "utf-8"))
print (four)
result will be:

b'YWxleEBhbGV4LmFsZXg='
I want to remove the b'' from four. So that only YWxleEBhbGV4LmFsZXg= is shown. How do I go about getting just the string YWxleEBhbGV4LmFsZXg= withouth the byte type?

python string encoding base64

You have a bytes object; decode it to Unicode:

print(four.decode('ascii'))
Base64 only us
