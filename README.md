LFTP, a network application, supports large file transfer between two computers in the Internet.

## Dependency

Operating System: `linux /macOS /windows`

Environment: `>= python 3.6`

## Usage

For **macOS** user, type the command in your terminal first to enable transferring the max size of the UDP packet:
```shell
sudo sysctl -w net.inet.udp.maxdgram=65535
```

Before you use this program, on the server-side, you should make a folder named `data` under `code/` first to store the files to exchange with clients:

```shell
cd code
mkdir data
```

Then, you could run command below to run the program on the server:

```shell
# use python 3.x
python ./server.py [hostname port]
# default hostname: localhost
# default port: 8080
```

After that, you could run the command below to connect and exchange files with the server:

```shell
# use python 3.x
python ./client.py lget/lsend hostname[:port] filename
# default port: 8080
```

Hope you enjoy your time with it.

## The technical requirements
- Programing language: `Python`;
- LFTP should use a **client-server** service model;
- LFTP must include a client side program and a server side program; Client side program can not only send a large file to the server but also download a file from the server.
  >Sending file should use the following format:
  >*LFTP lsend myserver mylargefile*
  >Getting file should use the following format: 
  >*LFTP lget myserver mylargefile*
  >The parameter myserver can be a url address or an IP address.

- LFTP should use **UDP** as the transport layer protocol.
- LFTP must realize **100% reliability** as TCP;
- LFTP must implement **flow control** function similar as TCP;
- LFTP must implement **congestion control** function similar as TCP;
- LFTP server side must be able to **support multiple clients** at the same time;
- LFTP should provide **meaningful debug information** when programs are executed.

## The Design Doc

**Simple introduction** of design are shown below:

- **Transport Layer: RDP Protocol**
    - **Packet Structure**
        <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th align="center" colspan=2>
                UDP packet data field
                </th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        
        <tbody>

            <td align="center" colspan=2>Sequence Number</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="center" colspan=2>Data</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
    - **Fundament**
        According to the Application layer requests, *send data and receive data* function are fundamental and application needn't know the implementation. Thus, we first design two functions: **`rdp_send(data)`** to send data and **`rdp_recv(size)`** to get data.
        Furthermore, these two function should act like TCP, which means application just invokes functions and **knows** where it get/send data. So we need to make connection between server and client before invoking these functions with *handshake behavior*. **`makeConnection(targetAddress)`** is needed.

    - **Multiple Client**
        Since server must support multiple client, the server application(host) must handle the clients at the same time. So **multiple thread** is needed. We provide each connected client a *server program* running in different *port*. So we design **`listen(num)`** function to *listen* the connection requests from clients and maximum number of client for server to serve is `num`. The listen function provides the *listening* and helps make connection between server and client. Hence, sockets are created when connection successfully made in `listen`, we must export the serving socket for server application. **`accept()`** retrieve a serving socket and server application must run the socket in a thread and handle it.

    - **Summary**
        **`rdp_send(data)`**,**`rdp_recv(size)`**,**`makeConnection(targetAddress)`**,**`listen(num)`** and **`accept()`** are the most important function designed in RDP. Following, we will introduce the implementation and the detail design of them.
